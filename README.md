Health Mentee

## **Problem Statement**
Bridging the gap between doctors and patients, transforming in-person one to one interaction to over-the-internet remote video calls,
providing a platform where patients can meet with respective doctors in just few seconds.

## **Project Description**
Currently to consult a doctor, one needs to go on premises, and have one to one interaction with the doctor.
There are number of restriction to this, for example,
- Doctors may not be available 
- Emergency Hours is outside working hours 
- Distance to the hospital is far away 
- National Holiday / Lockdown (as in Covid) etc. <br>

### **Solution to this** 
My project will address these problems.
My project is to bridge this gap between doctors and patients and to develop a platform which can provide 24 hours consultancy services where with just a click you can get a doctor (your **Health Mentee**) over a **Microsoft Teams video call.**
Types of doctors (**Health Mentee**) will also be very diversified ranging from general physicians to experienced doctors.
Along with this website will also have a **Azure Health Bot** which will help the user to get basic understanding of their symptoms, along with this an **online pharmacy** for buying medicines and booking scans schedule will also be there for smoother user experience of the patients.
